# The best of Lambda Days 2015

### Introduction

You can look with admiration and envy to the US based conferences like [Strangeloop](https://thestrangeloop.com/) or [Erlang Factory San Francisco](http://www.erlang-factory.com/sfbay2015/home). Of course, Polish landscape year after year looks only better (e.g. amazing [DevDay](http://devday.pl/), [EuroClojure 2014](http://lanyrd.com/2014/euclojure/) or coming [Elixir Conf EU 2015](http://www.elixirconf.eu/)), but still - I was not aware of fact, that there is conference dedicated purely to *functional programming*. Thanks to the [@lechglowiak](https://twitter.com/lechglowiak) I discovered such amazing conference in Kraków (relatively close to the place where I live).

Yes, I am talking about [Lambda Days 2015](http://lambdadays.org/). Organization, venue and prepared tracks are raised the bar really high. Great kudos to the organizers, for creating such amazing event! I am really glad that I could participate in such awesome and inspiring experience.

In this blog post I would like to focus on the best presentations which I have seen live. Of course list is far from complete, because parallel tracks caused sometimes really hard choices. I am still catching up with the rest of talks, thanks to the uploaded [videos](https://vimeo.com/tag:Lambda+Days).

### My Top 5

- [How computers change our brains. Can screen-time cause mental or neurological disorders?](https://vimeo.com/121374004) by *Kinga Panasiewicz* - Very inspiring and scientific talk about the most precious part of our bodies - *brain*. As people which are constantly learning and what is even more important - we use it in our daily work without rest, we should know almost everything about it. I am a little biased, because I love learning about that topics, but I recommend watching it.
  - **Good health (especially mental health) is a key for effective and fun work**.
- Understanding Cancer Behavior with F# by *Evelina Gobasova* - Being a part of such research team can be very intimidating, but also very rewarding. Your impact as a computer scientist cannot be more meaningful than that. Highly inspiring talk, with many technical details related with very interesting programming language on the *`.NET`* platform - *F#*. If you are interested in type providers or using functional programming as a data scientist it is highly recommended to watch it (*but it is not uploaded yet*).
- Building systems in Clojure by *Matthias Nehlsen* - I am following Matthias blog and work (on his [book](https://leanpub.com/building-a-system-in-clojure)) and I was not disappointed. Presentation describes practical approach to building systems, not only in Clojure, but in general with use of functional programming language. If you are interested in such details, I recommend to watch this talk (*but it is not uploaded yet*).
- [State, Communication and Side-Effects in Idris](https://vimeo.com/123606435) by *Edwin Brady* - I was blown away by features and capabilities of [Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/example/). Literally, this talk just blown my mind - *dependent types* looks really promising. Even if someone claims that they are purely academical thing for now (but in presented context it does not look as a purely theoretical work) it is still valuable at least to briefly look at it.
- Lessons from Erlang VM by *Michał Ślaski* - I am a huge fan of *Erlang* ecosystem, mainly because of pragmatism and focusing on building *reliable* and *resilient*  systems. Moreover, a lot of time we speak how to build such systems and we treat the maintenance part as a *side-effect* and something not worth our attention. But it should exactly opposite - most of the time related with software lifetime is spent in the maintenance phase. We need to build mission critical systems on solid foundation, with maintenance in mind from the *day 0*. Talk recommended for people interested in getting familiar with platform features, which eases building systems with such requirements (*but it is not uploaded yet*).

### Stickers on participant badges and Lambda Academy

During conference there was a very interesting exhibition. I noticed, as probably like the most of the people, strange sticker on my participant's badge. It turns out, that one of the stands has *Raspberry Pi* installation with NFC tag reader (yes, it is a NFC-powered sticker) connected to [MongooseIM](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/products/mongooseim-massively-scalable-ejabberd-platform) server which receives an XMPP message each time when someone scanned a badge. Everything built with Erlang (even the sticker scanner). **Awesome idea!**

### Summary

I definitely recommend this conference to anyone in future, especially if it is a curious person, open and eager to learn new stuff, especially related with functional programming. I am looking forward to the next edition of Lambda Days! :wink:

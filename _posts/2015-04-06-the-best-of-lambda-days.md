# The best of Lambda Days 2015

### Introduction

You can look with admiration and envy to the US based conferences like [Strangeloop](https://thestrangeloop.com/) or [Erlang Factory San Francisco](http://www.erlang-factory.com/sfbay2015/home). Of course, Polish landscape year after year looks only better (e.g. amazing [DevDay](http://devday.pl/), [EuroClojure 2014](http://lanyrd.com/2014/euclojure/) or coming [Elixir Conf EU 2015](http://www.elixirconf.eu/)), but still - I was not aware of fact, that there is conference dedicated purely to *functional programming*. Thanks to the [@lechglowiak](https://twitter.com/lechglowiak) I discovered such amazing conference in Kraków (relatively close to the place where I live).

Yes, I am talking about [Lambda Days 2015](http://lambdadays.org/). Organization, venue and prepared tracks are raised the bar really high. Great kudos to the organizers, for creating such amazing event! I am really glad that I could participate in such awesome and inspiring experience.

In this blog post I would like to focus on the best presentations which I have seen live. Of course list is far from complete, because parallel tracks caused sometimes really hard choices. I am still catching up with the rest of talks, thanks to the uploaded [videos](https://vimeo.com/tag:Lambda+Days).

### My Top 5

- Kinga Panasiewicz - How computers change our brains. Can screen-time cause mental or neurological disorders?
  - Inspiring, refreshing, scientific.
- Evelina Gobasova - Understanding Cancer Behavior with F#.
  - Life changing, Inspiring, F#.
- Matthias Nehlsen - Building systems in Clojure.
  - Clojure, Architecture, System design.
- Edwin Brady - State, Communication and Side-Effects in Idris.
  - Dependent typing, Scientific, Refreshing.
- Michał Ślaski - Lessons from Erlang VM
  - Erlang, Sectional, Focus on maintenance and reliability.

### Stickers on participant badges and Lambda Academy

During conference there was a very interesting exhibition. I noticed, as probably like the most of the people, strange sticker on my participant's badge. It turns out, that one of the stands has *Raspberry Pi* installation with NFC tag reader (yes, it is a NFC-powered sticker) connected to *MongooseIM* server which receives a XMPP message each time when someone scanned a badge. Everything built with Erlang (even the sticker scanner). Awesome idea!

I definitely recommend this conference to anyone in future, especially if it is a curious person, open and eager to learn new stuff, especially related with functional programming. I am looking forward to the next edition of Lambda Days! :wink:

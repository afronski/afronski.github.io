# Books that changed my career - Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good!

<quote class="disclaimer">This blog post is another one in the series which contains the most influential books that I have read in my programming career. This is my private ranking, each post contains a good dose of my private opinions (you have been warned :wink:), but besides that I hope that you will find it valuable.</quote>

### Introduction

<img class="right lysefgg-logo" alt="Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good! - Cover" src="/assets/LYSEFGGCover.jpg" />

- *TODO*: My way into *Erlang* - seeking for a good source of knowledge, which is up to date, pragmatic and has good covered.
- *TODO*: It should also learn *Erlang* thinking, idioms and it should start from ground up.
- *TODO*: It is a very wise, well thought, and not a general purpose book.
- *TODO*: It is really well written, it has very interesting style (illustrations!).
- *TODO*: It is still up to date, even after recent changes - *Erlang 18*, *Maps* etc.
- *TODO*: The most important thing is its very good coverage regarding stuff related with *Erlang* and *OTP*.
- *TODO*: Author is an experienced *Erlang* developer, well-known in the community.

### Why should I care?

- *TODO*: It is a very book for a specialized audience.
- *TODO*: Probably you won't be interested if you are not into *Erlang VM*.
- *TODO*: Besides that book, you should also read the Joe Armstrong's book "Programming Erlang, 2nd Edition".
- *TODO*: If you are into *Erlang* operations - the same author wrote a book *Erlang in Anger*, which is awesome - full of hints and useful guides.

### I don't like `Erlang` or `Elixir`. Should I still care?

**The shortest and simplest answer is no**. The longer one, needs much more investigation of problem's root.

- *TODO*: Why you don't like Erlang?
- *TODO*: You should at least be interested in any other language that handles concurrency in a different way than your daily tool.

# Books that changed my career - Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good!

<quote class="disclaimer">This blog post is another one in the series which contains the most influential books that I have read in my programming career. This is my private ranking, each post contains a good dose of my private opinions (you have been warned :wink:), but besides that I hope that you will find it valuable.</quote>

### Why should I care?

**The shortest and simplest answer is - you should care if you are interested in *Erlang VM* related topics**.

It is a book for a specialized audience. Probably you will not be interested if you are not interested in learning *Erlang* or diving into ecosystem built around it. But if you would like to learn a new programming language - it is a very good book for a newcomer. Besides that, you should also read the Joe Armstrong's book *"Programming Erlang, 2nd Edition"* - which is a classic position, written by one of language creators.

Also, if you are dealing with *Erlang* operations (e.g. you are a *DevOps* person in the project which uses *Erlang*), the same author wrote a book *Erlang in Anger*, which is an awesome source of knowledge - it is full of hints, small tools and scripts and many useful guides, based on author's extensive experience (*Heroku* is the place when you probably can deal with [huge amount of unusual problems](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/11/7/logplex-down-the-rabbit-hole) :wink:).

### About the book

<img class="right lysefgg-logo" alt="Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good! - Cover" src="/assets/LYSEFGGCover.jpg" />

That book was mine entry point into the *Erlang* world. It is a really good source of knowledge for newcomers, it is also complete - it covers all important topics from language basic syntax to more advanced topics related e.g. with *OTP* or building distributed systems. It is very pragmatic and *Fred* is continuously updating it (last changes are related with *maps* and changes in handling *time* which was introduced in the recently released 18th version of *Erlang VM*).

You will learn from this book a true *Erlang* approach. Book contains also idioms, but it is starting from the ground up. It has a well thought structure and also - it is really well written and it has very interesting style (you will not miss *illustrations* prepared for each chapter - they are sometimes funny).

The last, but not least - as I said in the previous paragraph - author [Fred Trottier-Hebert](https://twitter.com/mononcqc) is an experienced *Erlang* developer, he is well-known in the community (he was an *Erlang* user of the year), he wrote 2 books about *Erlang* and numerous blog posts on [his blog](http://ferd.ca/).

### I do not care about `Erlang` or `Elixir`. Should I still care?

**The shortest and simplest answer is no**. The longer one, needs much more investigation of problem's root.

*May I ask you why you don't like Erlang?* If you are already interested in any other language that is *functional* and *built with concurrency in mind*, then it is fine. But if not, you should learn a new one (pick any - `Clojure`, `F#` or `Erlang`). Just use a different language than your daily tool. You can read about that [here](http://www.afronski.pl/sicp-in-clojure/2015/06/04/sicp-in-clojure-chapter-1.html). And I will leave you with that till the next time! :smiley:

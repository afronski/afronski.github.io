# 500 shades of green

No, it is not fake. I did it - I have managed to have streak which last 500 days in a row and document on Github. But, you can search - there are couple of projects which allows you to create arbitrary history of your contributions (it uses a separate repository for that and well - it cheats using ability of `git` to bend the time). One is [here]().

No, it does not mean anything. I am not better than anyone else, quantity does not involve quality (I will describe this in details down below).

No, it does not mean that I did not have proper holidays or that I have spent all my free time on that.

## Why did you do that?

Mainly two reasons - *documentation* and *creating habits*.

Many of the repositories like [afronski/playground-notes](), [afronski/dotfiles]() or [afronski/papers_i_love]() is a pure private documentation of my notes, publicly visible settings and observations with commit history.

It also helped me when it comes to developing a good habits:

- Taking care about commit history, proper commit messages, linear and nice history, working with facilities like *rebasing*, *squashing* or *fix-ups* helped me a lot when it comes to actual work.
  - Besides that some commits have attached story with explanation why I applied that change. It is sometimes priceless, because I can drop my mental overhead. And when I hit the same wall again I can tackle it with certainty and exact solution.
- Also having a daily habit of delivering something valueable is crucial. It helps a lot when it comes to daily work, but also when it comes to developing other viable habits. It is easier to develop new habit on top of existing foundation.
  - It also helps regarding planning my weeks and during a lot of other activities - like meet-up organization, building communities around them or preparing real contributions to *open source communities*.

I cannot undermine the *fun factor* and that all the small things delivered daily sometimes formed something bigger, and *endorphine rush* related with a finished project cannot be underestimated.

## God Mode

Obviously, if you know `git` well you can cheat with the dates (e.g. when you skipped a day or two) - especially if that repository (or branch) is used by nobody else:

```
~ (my-private-branch) $ git commit --amend --date="Wed Feb 01 23:50 2016 +0100"
```

All rules regarding rewriting commit history of pushed shared branches are applicable to this case, so you have been warned. :wink:

## Quality != Quantity

Last, but not least - my daily streak means literally *nothing* when it comes to my skills. It can be only a indicator of my *stubborn nature* and *persistency*. Also, there are a lot of days which are really low when it comes to contributions (like changing a thing or two in a `README.md` file). That's not a full-blown contribution, but it still helps preserving the habit and it keeps you in the loop.

Just don't break the chain, and try as much as you can to deliver something - it will be still awesome, even if it will serve purpose only for you. It is like a *motivational perpetuum mobile*.

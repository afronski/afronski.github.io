# SICP in Clojure - Chapter 2

<quote class="disclaimer">In one of the <a href="http://www.afronski.pl/2015/06/01/books-that-changed-my-career-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs.html">previous blog posts</a> I have announced that I would like to start a new series of posts. It is a persistent journal from my journey through aforementioned book. I hope that you will enjoy it and find it useful - the main goal is to make this series a place where we can return in future, recall ideas and thoughts that accompanied reading process.</quote>

### Introduction

- Sum up whole chapter - it is all about clear and reasonable abstractions.
- Establishing barriers upfront helps evolution and builds a contract.
- Freedom and minimalist approach results in huge expression power.
- Recursion is not only important regarding flow control, but also for data structures.

### Compound Data Structures

- Clean interface.
- Constructors and selectors.
- Thanks to the abstraction, after establishing a contract, it is easy to change implementation underneath.

### Barriers

- Conventional interface.
- Contracts.

### Freedom and Elasticity

- *DSL*
- Building type systems.
- Minimal syntax can result with introducing rules on the semantic level.

### Introduction to *homoiconicity*

- Operating on symbols.
- A small step before transforming an *AST*.

### *Interesting Examples*

- Rational numbers.
- Symbolical operations - derivation.
- Set implementation.
- Graphical language as a *DSL*.

### Credits

- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs), *Harold Abelson*, *Gerald Jay Sussman* and *Julie Sussman*

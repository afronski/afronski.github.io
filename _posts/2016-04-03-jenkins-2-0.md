# Jenkins 2.0

## Introduction

Recently maintainers of the leading and most popular open source automation server - *Jenkins* - announced that long awaited *2.0* release [is available to download, because it is marked as a beta](https://jenkins.io/2.0/). It means that they're still recommending current *LTS* version for a production deployments, but new version is coming soon.

So let's look what it offers!

## What's new?

### Improved usability (aka "New UI")

That is probably the most single awaited feature for Jenkins. It means a lot for both - power users and newcomers. A lot of feedback was taken into account when preparing that release. Old pages (e.g. *Create Item* or *Job Configuration*) look sweet and clean (we have finally tabs in configuration page), new views like *Pipeline Stage view* (we will describe whole feature in the next chapter) look even more awesome:

But that's not the end of goodies from that release.

### Delivery pipelines

Finally Jenkins will be packaged with built-in delivery pipelines feature. It means that it will not require plugins anymore for doing that. It brings finally support for `Jenkinsfile` - concept which allows codify your pipelines, and store it inside version control (either together with application source code or outside, in one of your supporting repositories). Besides that no more *XML* fiddling when it comes to job configuration, because it will use a nice *DSL* for that:

{% highlight groovy %}
node {
  git url: 'https://github.com/joe_user/simple-maven-project-with-tests.git'

  def mvnHome = tool 'M3'
  sh "${mvnHome}/bin/mvn -B -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore verify"

  step([$class: 'ArtifactArchiver', artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', fingerprint: true])
  step([$class: 'JUnitResultArchiver', testResults: '**/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml'])
}
{% endhighlight %}

It is a well known concept, similar to the [*job DSL* plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin). But finally, it will be built-in and ready to use right after installation, without any additional effort.

### Fully backward compatibility

That is the most important thing - adding new stuff and improvements in UI means a lot for new users, but having those things and being fully backward compatible is a huge deal for people that are using Jenkins in production right now. As documentation states:

<quote class="citation">Jenkins 2.0 is a drop-in replacement of the Jenkins 1.x series of releases and fully backward compatible. There is practically no reason not to upgrade once 2.0 is released.</quote>

If that goal will be achieved it is a huge thing.

## How to play with it?

The easiest way to play with new Jenkins, will be to use prepared packages from the [aforementioned page](https://jenkins.io/2.0/). Maintainers prepared installers for any platform. Of course there is also a standard *`WAR`* distribution available there.

But there is even a simpler way to play with it for a Linux user. If you already have `docker` configured, you can spin it up with one command:

{% highlight bash %}
~ $ docker run --name jenkins2 -p 8080:8080 -d jenkinsci/jenkins:2.0-beta-1
{% endhighlight %}

And that's it! When that command will finish, on your local `8080` port there will be *Jenkins 2.0* waiting for you to configure and play with it.
And last but not least - if you have any feedback related with new version, official page [contains guides how to do it](https://jenkins.io/2.0/#feedback). Community will be grateful!

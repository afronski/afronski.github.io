## Plans for 2016

- Apply [100:10:1 rule](http://blog.fogus.me/2015/11/04/the-100101-method-my-approach-to-open-source/) to my open source work.
- Proceed with *cost-benefit analysis* and focus on *monetization* in terms of open source work.
- Try to kick-off another meet up in Silesia region - [Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/).
- Learning (even more than previously) about theory and how to design distributed and real-time systems.
- Focus on doing *interactive blog posts* and higher quality (premium?) materials.
- Push even harder work related with *quality* and *visibility* of blog posts.
- Take more time to [discover new music](http://www.last.fm/user/afronski).

Happy New Year! :wink:

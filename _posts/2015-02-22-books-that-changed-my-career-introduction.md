# Books that changed my career - Introduction

<quote class="disclaimer">This blog post is a starting point of a series which contains the most influential books that I have read in my programming career. This is my private ranking, each post will contain a good dose of my private opinions (you have been warned :wink:), but besides that I hope that you will find it valuable.</quote>

### Introduction

If you are a programmer and you like your profession, it is very likely that you are reading a lot of technical books. There are plenty of them on the market - related with craftsmanship, oriented fully around technology, patterns or methodologies and more. Besides practicing in your spare time - reading is probably the most important way of learning new stuff.

I read a lot of books, what is even more important - my reading queue is growing faster than my reading abilities - and what I found after while is that merely only a couple of them can be marked as a highly influential on my career. It is not only related with frequency that I am returning to it - there are some books which I find really valuable, but I have read it only once. So, what makes a book *good*?

Before we define that set of features, I would like to divert a little bit - **learning is hard**.

Especially if you are doing it in isolation (this is directly related with reading a book - you can do it within a book club, but still - it can uncomfortable or not enjoyable for someone). There is a very important concept related with learning new skill, when you are selecting a task which is only just slightly more difficult than your regular task, but still doable - it is the *sweet spot* where you can learn in the most effective way by yourself (learning in group is fundamentally different).

What I have observed is related with that *sweet spot* - books which I grouped in my private *the best of* list are related with that *concept* **and** with a particular *time* when I read it. That is why this list is perfectly viable for me, and can be irritating for you - especially if we are on the different level of skill acquisition for the particular set of features, covered in the described publication.

Today I would like to start with a very interesting book, but at the first sight it looks just like a classic example of <i>XYZ for dummies</i> guidebook. Such omission can result that you can miss very good publication.

#### Why this book?

### What's next?

Obviously mentioned book cannot be described in just one blog post, so I would like to announce that second blog post series will start immediately. There we will talk about each language presented in publication separately.

Regarding this series, next books are waiting, ready in the pipeline and I would like to share them with you. Next one, is a *must-read* book for every programmer, but in a different sense that you might think. If you have an idea about which one I am talking about, please post the title in the comment below. Either way - stay tuned! :wink:

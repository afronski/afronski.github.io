# SICP in Clojure - Chapter 3

<quote class="disclaimer">In one of the <a href="http://www.afronski.pl/books-that-changed-my-career/2015/06/01/books-that-changed-my-career-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs.html">previous blog posts</a> I have announced that I would like to start a new series of posts. It is a persistent journal from my journey through aforementioned book. I hope that you will enjoy it and find it useful - the main goal is to make this series a place where we can return in future, recall ideas and thoughts that accompanied reading process.</quote>

### Introduction

In the [previous blog post](http://www.afronski.pl/sicp-in-clojure/2015/06/04/sicp-in-clojure-chapter-2.html) ...

*TODO*:

- Short note about idiomatic Clojure, and why it is not purely idiomatic version.
- Use quote from Rich Hickey: "I personally don't think SICP will help you much with Clojure. YMMV." and address your point of view.

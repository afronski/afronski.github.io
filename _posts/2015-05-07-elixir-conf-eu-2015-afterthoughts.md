# Elixir Conf EU 2015 - Afterthoughts

### Introduction

In the [previous post](http://www.afronski.pl/2015/04/06/the-best-of-lambda-days.html) about interesting events, I have said that more of them will come in future. I have participated in one of these - *ElixirConf EU* in Krak√≥w and I must admit - it was the best conference I have ever been since [Falsy Values in 2011](http://lanyrd.com/2011/falsy-values/).

It was the second in the world conference about *Elixir* programming language, it brings almost 200 people interested in that topic to the former Polish capital. Most of people was either from *Ruby* or *Erlang* side and I think that such mixture is a *key thing* related to the *joy* and *success* of that event.

### Talks and Workshops

At a day before actual conference organizers prepared two workshops - one about *Phoenix* framework and one about *OTP and Elixir*. I have participated in the second one - it was a really nice experience. Workshop was full of knowledge, I have met interesting people, with very positive attitude, whom are willing to network and share their experiences. 

Actual conference days was started and ended with very nice keynotes - each of them was a different experience. We have very nice and thoughtful keynote from Joe Armstrong, which explains many problems related to the programming language design, from the perspective of *Elixir's* older brother - *Erlang*. Jose Valim presented bright future and interesting details related with *Elixir* evolution, and finally Chris had a very nice overview and development plans related with *Phoenix* framework.

But, I was also impressed by other talks. It was very interesting to see many use cases in which people used that piece of technology. I think that both groups have many valuable opinions and observations. For me, talks made by people with *Erlang* experience were particularly valuable, because they are coming from more mature technology. It is a different background and experiences.

### Atmosphere

I would like to focus on one particular element, which makes this conference so enjoyable - *people*. I have never met so many *nice* and *friendly* people. I have wonderful time during networking, countless talks during breaks or lunches. And to sum it up - during lightning talks *Jose Valim* and *Jim Freeze* received a *3D printed Elixir logo* designed in the [finFoil](http://hrobeers.github.io/finFoil/) software made by [@hrobeers](https://twitter.com/hrobeers).

Amazing community!

### Summary

It was a very good choice to invest my time and money in that event. Three days full of *energy*, *knowledge* and *experience* sharing. As a community we have interesting perspectives. We can derive from very experienced and stable *Erlang* ecosystem. We have a very nice and promising community, full of amazing and creative people. I will go definitely to the next *ElixirConf EU 2016* which take place in Berlin.

See you there! :smile:

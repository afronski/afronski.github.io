# SICP in Clojure - Chapter 4

<quote class="disclaimer">In one of the <a href="http://www.afronski.pl/books-that-changed-my-career/2015/06/01/books-that-changed-my-career-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs.html">previous blog posts</a> I have announced that I would like to start a new series of posts. It is a persistent journal from my journey through aforementioned book. I hope that you will enjoy it and find it useful - the main goal is to make this series a place where we can return in future, recall ideas and thoughts that accompanied reading process.</quote>

In the [previous blog post](http://www.afronski.pl/sicp-in-clojure/2015/09/18/sicp-in-clojure-chapter-3.html) ...

*TODO*:

- Metalinguistic Abstraction.
  - DSL, Notations.
  - Metacyclic Evaluators.
- Lisp core - `eval` / `apply` in context of *Clojure*.
  - Do not implement your own evaluators in *Clojure*, instead play with concepts described in that chapter.
- Lazy Evaluator - explanation.
  - `lazy-seq`, `repeatedly` and other functions in more details.
- Amb Evaluator - explanation.
  - Example implementation here: https://github.com/abeppu/toychest
- Logic Evaluator - explanation.
  - Logic Evaluator - implement examples and exercises in `core.logic` from *Clojure*.

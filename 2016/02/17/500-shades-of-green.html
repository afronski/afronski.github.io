<p>No, it is not fake. I did it - I have managed to have real streak which last 500 days in a row and document it on Github. But, you can do it in a different way - there are couple of projects which allows you to create arbitrary history of your contributions (it uses a separate repository for that and well - it cheats using ability of <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> to bend the time).</p>

<p>One is <a href="https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti">here</a>. <img class="emoji" title=":wink:" alt=":wink:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>No, it does not mean anything. I am not a better programmer than anyone else, definitely quantity does not involve quality (I will describe this in details below).</p>

<p>No, it does not mean that I did not have proper holidays or that I have spent all my free time on that.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-do-that">Why did you do that?</h2>

<p>Mainly because of two reasons: <em>documentation</em> and <em>creating habits</em>.</p>

<p>Many of the repositories like <a href="https://github.com/afronski/playground-notes">afronski/playground-notes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/afronski/dotfiles">afronski/dotfiles</a> or <a href="https://github.com/afronski/papers_i_love">afronski/papers_i_love</a> are pure and private documentation of my notes, publicly visible settings and observations with commit history.</p>

<p>It also helped me when it comes to developing new habits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Taking care about commit history, proper commit messages, linear and nice history. Working with facilities like <em>rebase</em>, <em>squash</em> or <em>fix-ups</em> helped me a lot in daily job.
    <ul>
      <li>Besides that some commits have attached story with explanation why I applied that change. It is sometimes priceless, because I can drop my mental overhead related to <em>fear of forgetting something important</em>. And when I hit the same wall again I can tackle it with certainty and exact solution. Example <a href="https://github.com/afronski/dotfiles/commit/12305ca407a1fed3b2aafb0f3ccb194d8f429c81">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Also having a daily habit of delivering something valuable is crucial. It helps a lot when it comes to daily work, when it comes to planning the workload, actual steps to be done.
    <ul>
      <li>It also helps regarding planning my weeks and during a lot of other related activities - like meet-up organization, building community around them or preparing real contributions to <em>open source projects</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Another point is related with developing other habits. It is easier to develop a new habit on top of existing foundation.</li>
</ul>

<p>I cannot overlook the <em>fun factor</em> and that <em>all the small things</em> delivered daily sometimes formed something bigger, and <em>endorphin’s rush</em> related with a finished project cannot be underestimated.</p>

<h2 id="god-mode">God Mode</h2>

<p>Obviously, if you know <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> well you can cheat with the dates (e.g. when you skipped a day or two) - especially if that repository (or branch) is not used by anyone:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">~ <span class="o">(</span>my-private-branch<span class="o">)</span> <span class="nv">$ </span>git commit <span class="nt">--amend</span> <span class="nt">--date</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"Wed Feb 01 23:50 2016 +0100"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>All rules regarding rewriting commit history of pushed shared branches are applicable also in this case, so you have been warned. <img class="emoji" title=":wink:" alt=":wink:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h2 id="quality--quantity">Quality != Quantity</h2>

<p>Last, but not least - my daily streak means literally <em>nothing</em> when it comes to my skills. It can be only a indicator of my <em>stubborn nature</em> and <em>persistence</em>. Also, there are a lot of days which are really low when it comes to contributions value (like changing a thing or two in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file). That’s definitely not a full-blown contribution, but it still helps preserving the habit and it keeps you in the loop.</p>

<p>Hey - it still counts if you feel better afterwards! <em>Why so serious</em>? <img class="emoji" title=":wink:" alt=":wink:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png" height="20" width="20"> It is just a pile of green squares. Just don’t break the chain, and try as much as you can to deliver something - it will be still awesome, even if it will serve purpose only for you. For me it is like a <em>motivational perpetuum mobile</em> - I wish you the same thing!</p>

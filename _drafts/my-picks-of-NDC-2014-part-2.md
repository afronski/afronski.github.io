# My picks of NDC 2014 - part II

1. [Venkat Subramaniam - Towards an Evolutionary Architecture](https://vimeo.com/97537675) - Very nice talk which summarizes all necessary things which are important about Architecture. An architect in Agile is made an obsolete by many people, but actually it is the opposite. Good architecture defers decisions, enables evolution and moreover handles or even removes completely the complexity. Besides that - very nice approach to prioritize features and assignments by the business value and the architectural impact - by doing that you can really avoid many pitfalls when you are moving forward and crush the knowledge during building the application.
2. [Cory House - Becoming an Outlier: Career Reboot for the Developer Mind](https://vimeo.com/97415346) - Definitely recommended video to watch. For many people it will be a mind and eye opening experience. Handful of valuable thoughts and advices how to manage your career, change your habits and adapt in the continuously changing environment.
3. [Roy Osherove - Beautiful Builds](https://vimeo.com/97516289) - Very refreshing talk. It starts by very obvious, but very often forgotten statement that *automated builds are not the continuous integration*. It introduces important concept of *shipping skeleton*. Mixing operational knowledge with building and deployment knowledge is also an anti-pattern. Talk contains a very useful set of patterns and best practices about CI and even Continuous Deployment - definitely recommended.
4. [Doc Norton - The Technical Debt Trap](https://vimeo.com/97507576) - Very wise and mindful explanation of Technical Debt metaphor (and moreover - the good and true one). If you are operating this metaphor and you often use it, please watch this presentation and be sure that all points which are related with true definition are fulfilled. Because if not, you are talking about *cruft* not *debt*. :wink:
5. [Joe Armstrong - The mess we're in](https://vimeo.com/97408239) - TODO.
6. [Aral Balkan - Free is a lie](https://vimeo.com/97505679) - TODO.
7. [Venkat Subramaniam - Core Software Design Principles](https://vimeo.com/97541185) - TODO.
8. [Garrett Smith - Functional code considered Beautiful](https://vimeo.com/97337252) - TODO.
9. [Mathias Brandewinder - F# and Machine Learning: a winning combination](https://vimeo.com/97514517) - TODO.

### Introduction

*TODO*: Possible topics:

- Ansible vs. Chef
- V8, Compilation Cache, Function.prototype.toString (it returns everything),
  trick with UID in the comment of function body (for distinguishing JITed
  functions) and why functions with huge comments are de-optimized by V8 (they
  are too big for cache).

# What's wrong with `gen_event`?

# [TEMPLATE]

*TODO*: Possible topics:

- Hard supervision.
- How to handle handler failure? ;)
- The same process for the all handlers.
- GenRouter for the rescue?
  - Link to the Jose Valim's talk.
- Hides the complexity underneath (where are the handlers in `observer:start().`, oh it is not a proces).
- Not widely used in the core and OTP.

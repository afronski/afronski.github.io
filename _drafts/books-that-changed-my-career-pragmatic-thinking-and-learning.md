# Books that changed my career - Pragmatic Thinking and Learning

<quote class="disclaimer">This blog post is a starting point of a series which contains the most influential books that I have read in my programming career. This is my private ranking, each post will contain a good dose of my private opinions (you have been warned :wink:), but besides that I hope that you will find it valuable.</quote>

### Introduction

- Talk about need for self-awareness.
- Feedback, Learning, Thinking - three pillars of evolution.
- We are learning all the time.

<h3 class="center"><em>Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware</em></h3>

#### Why this book?

- Book's structure.
- Nice and Interesting tricks.
- Cognitive Science.
- Meditation, Lizard's Brain - Basics of Neuroscience.
- Obvious parts - about coding standards, taste, Dreyfus Acquisition Scale.
- Non-obvious parts - oblique statements, etc.
- GTD and Effectiveness.

### What's next?

I am aware of fact that I have started this series with less obvious positions in the programmer's library. For the next review, I would like to shift a little bit - to the more standard and established books. This is a classical one, again from the *Pragmatic Programmers* sign. I have three copies of this book: in English (as an *ebook*), in Polish (again, as an ebook), but the most valuable for me is the printed Polish version, which I have received from my friend, with an inscription. Stay tuned! :wink:

  - Observations:
    - Different definitions, different results for smaller population.
    - Decile, Quantile, Percentile.
      - Difference between Percentage and Percentile.
      - Visualization on normal distribution.
        - What about other distributions?

          - Shiny + MathJax?
      - Z-score and percentiles relationship.
        - How to calculate percentile from z-score?
      - Why averaging percentiles is wrong?
    - Population, stupid!

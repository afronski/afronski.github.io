### Introduction

*TODO*

### Summary

In the next blog post we will talk about my favorite programming language - about *[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org)*. It has unique approach to the concurrency, it is mature and battle-tested platform, which has still active and vibrant community (recently expanded by a fast growing *Elixir* community). So, see you at the next blog post! :wink:

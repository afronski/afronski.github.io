# Interesting Language Features - Erlang III

<quote class="disclaimer">This blog post is an article from a series which contains examples, explanations and details about interesting features of various programming languages. I have collected several examples of different characteristics, which definitely extended my view regarding programming, architecture and structure in general. I would love to hear your feedback about presented choices or description of yours favorite programming language feature.</quote>

### Introduction

- *TODO*: What is a *behavior*?
- *TODO*: What is an *application* in *Erlang*?
- *TODO*: Why am I tackling this topic (there is nothing obvious in books and it is an interesting problem to analyze)?
- *TODO*: Topic arisen during work on `afronski/wolves-and-rabbits-world-simulation`.

### Internals

- *TODO*: Supervision tree and processes structure (screen from *Observer* tool).
- *TODO*: Application Controller.
- *TODO*: Application Master.
- *TODO*: Why there are two processes?

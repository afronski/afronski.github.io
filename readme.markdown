## Customization

There's a few other places that you'll want to change, too:

- [CNAME](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/CNAME): If you're using
  this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, you'll want to change this
  to be the domain you're going to use. All that should be in here is a
  domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
- [favicon.ico](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/favicon.ico): This
  is a smaller version of my gravatar for use as the icon in your browser's
  address bar. You should change it to whatever you'd like.
- [apple-touch-icon.png](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/apple-touch-icon.png):
  Again, this is my gravatar, and it shows up in iOS and various other apps
  that use this file as an "icon" for your site.
